# APN Setting Instructions

1. **The Standard Version of FBox Setting Process**

1.1. FBox selection and operator selection are detailed in the attached table "FBox available 4G global frequency band division and main operator correspondence table"

**1.2. Find the APN of the mobile network operator**

For example, the box needs to be installed in Saudi Arabia. In the Kingdom of Arabia \(Saudi Arabia\), by querying "FBox Available 4G Global Frequency Band Allocation and Corresponding Table of Major Operators", the model is FBox-4G, and the operator selected is "Mobily". Log in to "http://apn.how/" for specific APN
