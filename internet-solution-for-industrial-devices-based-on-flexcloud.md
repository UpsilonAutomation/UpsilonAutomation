**Background**

Generally industrial boilers are applied in the electricity-generating or air supply application occasions, and are widely used in energy, chemical industry, building material, hearing and other industries. Currently, industrial boilers are more and more professiona, and the requirement for equipment safety is also getting higher and higher.

1. You need to know the running status of the filed equipment in time, record the quipment running data in real-time, master the quipment fault at the earliest time, and provide after-class service timely.

2. On the other hand, for the needs of saving energy and fine management, you need collect and sort a large number of equipment running data, to provide data support for equipment energy managemnet and energy- saving reconstruction.

**Solution**

We can privide the solution for industrial boilers remote monitoring, which can make manufacturers monitor equipment and equipment data remotelu, master the running fault status of the quiment devices in time, and improve the after-sales serve timely, and provide the technical research and development of saving energy. 1. You can improve after-sale service, in the company, you can also know the equipment running and fault status of each device. Besides, you can monitor and debud the program remotely, master and solve equipment fault time, improve after-sales service efficinecy and quality, which can save a lot of traveling time and cost.

2. Through collecting and sorting equipment running data, you can master the product technical parameters and running data timely to provide data support for industrial boiler energy management and energy-saving reconstruction.![](.gitbook/assets/27%20%282%29.jpeg)

**Background**

Machanical equipment industry is high competitive, and the profit is less and less, so equipment manufacturing enterprises must ungrade products and improve service efficiency to achieve the transfomr and upgrading. At present, some enterprises want to establish a set of equipmetn platform to manage tens of thousands of units they sold and master the status and maintenance situation of these device at any time. The customer hopes to use the data:

1. On the basis of selling products, providing customers with full product life cycle of maintenance service and enhancing the quality of service, to realize the transformation and upgrading of the enterprice.

2. Using data to he;p the research and develop department analyze the parameter of different types of equipment for product development and upgrading better.

3. Conuting operating rate, use efficiency, the habits of using and other data etc, to provide the markting department with data support for precision marketing.

**Solution**

The original scatter management will be intergated into orderly management through remote communication

module.

1. The managers can view the real-time running status, parameters and faults of each monitoring device at the palce, and they can collect the data information of each monitoring equipment, then transfer the collected data to the cloud to process and store.

2. The main functions of equipment remote managemnet and monitroing palform includes equipment file management, real-time monitoring and larm, equipment safety, miantenance, staticstical analysis, etc.

3. Provideing WEB clinet or APP client at the same time for displaying, analysis, diagnosis and managing to help the enterprise reduce the cost the quipment management, improve equipment management and ultization efficency, prmote the marktet competitive of the enterprises.

**Background**

More and more equipment manufacturing enterprise are changing operating modes, from selling to leasing , the type and quantity of leasing equipment are also more. After the equipment is leased, a set of remote management platform is needed to achieve the unity of the equipment management and services, mainly including:

1. You can record equipment running parameters to realize the automatic caculation of rental and remind remotely through FBox.

2. You can maintenance equipment devices remotely.

3. You can set rent owning fees reminder and remote management.

**Solution**

Using FBox and cloud software, you can achieve leasing equipment remote managemnet and maintenance,

solution and advantages:

1. The connection is easy and convenient, and most PLC and controller are supported.

2. Using equipment management platform, you can achieve leasing equipment remote managemnet and maintenance, rental calculation and reminding.

3. Interface opening, it can be accessed to the self-developed leasing management platform or developed by a thrid party to provide the running data of the filed equipment.
